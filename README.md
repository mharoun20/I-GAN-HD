Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and have been applied to a wide range of image-related tasks. In the field of hit discovery, GANs can be used to generate 2D images of compounds that have a high likelihood of being active compounds. In this work, we propose a GAN-based approach for hit discovery by using 2D images of compounds as the input. Our approach is composed of two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained to generate new, synthetic images of compounds that are similar to the real images in the training set, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake images. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for both the generator and discriminator, which is well-suited for image-related tasks. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a benchmark dataset of 2D images of compounds and demonstrate that our GAN-based approach is able to generate new, diverse and high-quality images of compounds that have a high likelihood of being active. This method can be used to generate new compound libraries to be used in drug discovery and thus increase the chances of discovering new leads.
